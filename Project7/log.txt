Setting Up
----------
To begin this lab, I needed to set up the drivers for the BeagleBone. To do
this I plugged it into my PC through the micro USB cable. Next, I opened the
device on my PC and opened the START.htm file. This took me to the page and I
downloaded the 64-bit installer. Windows wouldn't allow me to install unsigned
drivers so I opened a Command Prompt with admin privileges and used the
following command:

$ bcdedit /set testsigning on

Now, the drivers were able to be installed. After restarting my machine, I used
Putty to SSH into 192.168.7.2. I logged in as "root". I then ran the following
commands:

$ sudo connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on

I then saw the connection I wanted to make, it had the following label:

Ryan's Galaxy       wifi_2cf7f1066a13_5279616e27732047616c617879_managed_none

I connected this one by using the following command:

connmanctl> connect wifi_2cf7f1066a13_5279616e27732047616c617879_managed_none
connmanctl> quit

Then I used the "ifconfig" command to get my IP address: 192.168.43.147

Next, I had to update my board and download Firefox. I did this with the
following commands:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install xauth
$ apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb

After this, I was able to begin the lab.

SSH Setup and Use in Applications
---------------------------------
To start this lab, I ran the first 2 commands:

$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
$	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$	sudo apt-get install openssh-client

This made sure both the server and client were installed. I then generated the
public and private keys.

Server
------
$ ssh-keygen

When prompted to enter a file, I didn't change the default location and I just
pressed Enter. I set the passphrase and received the following key randomart:

The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|         .o..    |
|         . .     |
|      . o   . o  |
|       o o   +   |
|        S     . .|
|       .     . oo|
|            E +.=|
|             +.=o|
|              =**|
+-----------------+

I then made a user with the following command:

$ sudo useradd -d /home/homedir -m Miao
$ sudo passwd Miao

I then set my password and waited for Ashley Miao to perform the Client steps.
Once she logged into my host, she ran an echo command and pipepined the output
into a file called am.txt. On my side, I ran the ls command and saw that the
only file within the directory was am.txt. When running the who command, I was
able to see that Ashley was on the server. We originally had an issue with
xterm and the following command:

$ xterm
-sh: 1: xterm: not found

When we ran the following commands:

$ apk get-install xvfb
$ apk get-install xterm

Which still did not fix the issue. After checking Piazza we read a post that
specified that we needed to reset our boards. This fixed the issue and all
commands opened their own shell window.

Client
------
Ashley and I then swapped roles and she created credentials for me to log onto
her server with. I copied the public key to the server using the following
commands:

$ ssh-copy-id -i Miyahara@192.168.43.22
$ ssh-add

Next I could log into her server using the following command.

$	ssh Miyahara@192.168.43.22
$	ssh -X Miyahara@192.168.43.22

When using the -X variant I was able to run xterm, gedit, and firefox without
an issue this time. I also ran an echo command and pipelined its contents into
rm.txt. When Ashley ran the ls command, she could see rm.txt, and when she ran
the who command, she was able to see me.
