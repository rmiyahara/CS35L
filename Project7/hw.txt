1. If the other teams had actually been observing all the bytes across the
server, the resulting network would still be secure because Ashley and I had
given each other our public keys to encrypt our bytes. If the other teams had
tapped our keyboards on the other hand, the network would no longer be secure.
This is because the other teams would have our keystrokes before the network
would be able to encode them. This means they would have our username and
passwords which would give them access to the server. If the other teams
physically had control of our the USB, our network wouldn't be secure either
due to the other teams possibly having our private key.

2. The gpg --verify command doesn't really verify that I personally created the
tar in question because it simply compares the signature of the creator to the
public key. This means anyone who wanted to could just use their own signature
and public key and it would always match as long as it came from the same user.
This problem has already been fixed using certificate authority. This gives out
a test to see if the user that created the file originally and the public keys
are the same. This way, someone couldn't simply swap out files and sign any
name they like.
