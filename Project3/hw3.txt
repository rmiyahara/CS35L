Q1) Bradey's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:" because it is
removed from the loop in the function. By removing the line from the for loop
in the third part of the patch, the function is no longer called, making the
case useless. Technically, you do not have to remove this line, but it keeps
your code concise by doing so.

Q2) If the Coreutils patch is used over the default one, people reading the ls
lines may be confused if they do not understand English formatting. If this
happens, months and days could be easily confused and could affect development.

Q3) When the script is invoked with an empty file, I recieve the following
output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "./randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "./randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is
    empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This makes sense because the chooseline function attempts to pick a random line
between 0 and the total amount of lines. Since there are no lines, any number
that is chosen would be out of the range of the file. Therefore, we receive an
IndexError.

Q4) When compiled using Python 3,
$ python3 randline.py -n3 hw3.txt
I received the following error:

File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This error happens because Python 3 no longer supports automatic tuple
unpacking. Automatic tuple unpacking is a feature that lets the user pass
arguments, like (arg1, arg2), as one single argument. The removal of this
feature creates the syntax error shown in the output.
