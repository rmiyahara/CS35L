To compare sfrob and sfrobu, I used 3 different inputs. The first had short
input and had 2 comparisons. The next had 17 comparisons (the example from
Project 4). The last was a huge file made by repeating the medium input file
over 1000 times. By creating a comparing counter and printing it during each
comparison, I found that the large input had 570928 comparisons. When using the
time commands, I received the following outputs:

As we can see, the longer the input becomes, the longer sfrobu takes compared
to sfrob. This is due to sfrobu using system calls rather than buffered I/O.
With the others, we can see that sfrobs and sfrobs -f is a constant time unlike
all the others. This could be due to the fact that it is a shell script rather
than a C program. The amount of system calls must be constant to maintain this
constant time function. The flagged version of sfrobu always takes
significantly longer than its none flagged counterpart. For all programs, the
longer the input given, the further the time difference becomes. This is due
tto a proportional amount of system calls being made to the larger input.
