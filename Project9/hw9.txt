Step 1
------
I created hw9.txt in my "Project9" directory:

$ touch hw9.txt

Step 2
------
First, I had to checkout v3.0 of the Diffutils just like the lab portion
of this assignment. The only difference is I had to check out as a new
branch named "quote". To find out how to do this I used git checkout's man
page. The man page informed me that I would need to use the -b flag after
the original branch's name, and the new name following that. I then used
the following command:

$ cp -r ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils diffutils
$ cd diffutils
$ git checkout 'v3.0' -b 'quote'

Step 3
------
Next, I applied the changes from the lab using the quote-3.0-patch.txt
patch I made.

$ cd ..
$ cp quote-3.0-patch.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt
$ cd diffutils
$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

Step 4
------
I then learned about the add-change-log-entry-other-window Emacs function
through the link in the specs. Apparently, this function adds to the change
log for this current file.

Step 5
------
With the knowledge from the previous step. I made a ChangeLog entry from
the quote-3.0-patch. I did this by editing each file that was modified
(I used git status to check this) and using the add-change-log-entry-other-
window function to make ChageLog.

Step 6
------
For this step, I had to commit the changes made by the patch. I knew to use
the git commit command, but I looked at its man page first. The flags that
are important to this step are the -a flag (signals to stage all modified
files) and the -F flag (so we can signal ChangeLog).

$ cp src/ChangeLog ChangeLog
$ git commit -aF ChangeLog

Step 7
------
Next, I used the git format-patch command to create a new patch. I put this
output into a file titled "formatted-patch.txt". From the lab, I remembered
to use the -1 flag to specify only this commit. I also remembered to specify
--stdout

$ git format-patch -1 --stdout >formatted-patch.txt

Using Emacs, I found the file contained the differences as well as the
ChangeLog entries.

Step 8
------
For step 8, I chose Ashley Miao as my partner to verify my patch.
